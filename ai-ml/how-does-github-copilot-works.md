    &#x20;In this project, I delved into the internals of Github Copilot. I [wrote](https://github.com/thakkarparth007/copilot-inspector) a tool to decompile Copilot's VSCode extension, and identified key insights regarding prompt construction logic, post processing of model's output and telemetry collection (_after sifting through over 400 obfuscated modules!_). I also built a [code browser](https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/codeviz/templates/code-viz.html) to intuitively explore the codebase. I wrote a [blog post](https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals) about it that got a [little](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1608895189078380544) [bit](https://twitter.com/parth007\_96/status/1604160949434421248) [popular](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34032872).
