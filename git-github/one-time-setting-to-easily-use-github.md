# one time setting to easily use Github

I find typing password/remembering tokens hard. So I have been a big fan of setting up ssh keys or the recent trick I found from my colleague Shuhaib.



To clone a repo:

```
git clone https://<MYUSERNAME>:<MYTOKEN>@github.com/scuzzlebuzzle/ol3-1.git
```

You can set remote like this way:

```
git remote set-url origin https://<MYUSERNAME>:<MYTOKEN>@github.com/scuzzlebuzzle/ol3-1.git
```
