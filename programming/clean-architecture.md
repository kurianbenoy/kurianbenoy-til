# Clean Architecture

It contains four layers, yet it's not just limited to it you can extend to as much as possible. The four layers are:

* Entities - like base class models for business code
* Use Cases/ Injectors
* Controllers
* External Interfaces\
  \
  Then the dependency injection aspect which takes one components, allows that components to be reused anywhere without any hesistancy.\
