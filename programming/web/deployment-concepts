## Deployment concept TLDR version for me later

Resource Utilization (keep it in 50 to 90%, use htop for monitoring)
Automatic start (done by docker, kubernetees etc)
Automatic Restart (ideally should be done by external system, but usually done with same starter)
Process - running program
Replication - Add more
HTTPS is important
